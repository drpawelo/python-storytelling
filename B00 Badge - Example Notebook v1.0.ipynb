    "3. And **CODE CELLS** with Python code (see below). Code cells have a ```In []``` written to the left.\n",
    "4. You can **RUN CODE CELLS** by clicking on them and pressing **Shift + Enter**. When you run a cell, the code inside will run (it \"happens\", the computer will do what you asked for it to do). Results of what your code does will appear underneath the cell.\n",
